# 7-min-workout
A web app to help you doing 7 min workout plan 
http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_r=2 .

I know there are already some apps for that, but I created it for fun.

Backlog:

- Polish code: I reused it from other app, so it has some incoherences.
- Add some music to motivate you when doing exercise.
- Add a funny end
- Modify layout: Maybe a big picture of the current exercise, better than a row of four and the red square for the current one.
- Upload to a server / domain
